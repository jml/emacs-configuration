# jml's emacs configuration

This is how I feel about my Emacs configuration::

    Turning and turning in the widening gyre
    The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
    Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
    Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
    The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
    The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
    The best lack all conviction, while the worst
    Are full of passionate intensity.

Catchy, no?

Anyway, if you can figure it out I'd really appreciate it if you could give me
a hint or something because I'm lost.

## Things to look into

* elpy / pyvenv
* company
* god-mode
* YouCompleteMe for Emacs
* popwin
* make yasnippet config much better
* more structured way of OS-specific & site-specific configuration
* markdown-mode that's based on [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/)
* various code search facilities
  * git grep
  * ag / ack
  * tags
* Python flycheck isn't as check-y as it might be
* Try out multiple-cursors (see
[hawkowl's gist](https://gist.github.com/hawkowl/5a9c4e74638b05b3a1d9))
* github gist support
* explore richer helm configuration
